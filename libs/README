iSpy needs these libraries in order to build. They are all distributed as pre-compiled libraries
as part of the iSpy git repo, but if you really want to build them yourself here's how to do it.

libcrypto.a + libssl.a
-----------------------
This is a git submodule. Actual repo: https://github.com/x2on/OpenSSL-for-iPhone
To build:

	cd /path/to/iSpy
	git submodule update
	cd OpenSSL-for-iPhone
	./build-libssl.sh
	# wait for ages while it builds openssl for x86, armv6, iPhone simulator, armv7 etc
	cp bin/iPhoneOS7.0-armv7.sdk/lib/*.a ../libs/   # the SDK version may be different for you.
	rm -rf src
	cd ..

HTTPKit.a
---------
This is a minimized, re-organized, and modified version of HTTPKit (https://github.com/mralexgray/HTTPKit).
All its dependencies have been patched and then lumped into one folder here. Mmmmm.
	https://github.com/mralexgray/HTTPKit/tree/master/Dependencies/CocoaOniguruma
	https://github.com/fjolnir/FABatching
	https://github.com/mralexgray/HTTPKit/tree/master/Dependencies/mongoose
This is NOT a git submodule, it's fully merged into the iSpy source tree.
To build:

	cd /path/to/iSpy/HTTPKit
	./build
	cd ..

That's it. The library will have be installed for you.

GRMustache.a
------------
This is a git submodule of https://github.com/groue/GRMustache
To build:

	cd /path/to/iSpy
	git submodule update
	cd GRMustache
	git submodule update --init src/vendor/groue/jrswizzle
	make

That's it. iSpy knows where to find the resulting library, libGRMustache6-iOS.a. No further action required :)
