iSpy needs these libraries in order to build. They are all distributed as pre-compiled libraries
as part of the iSpy git repo, but if you really want to build them yourself here's how to do it.

libcrypto.a + libssl.a
-----------------------
This is a git submodule. Actual repo: https://github.com/x2on/OpenSSL-for-iPhone
To build:

	cd /path/to/iSpy
	git submodule update
	cd OpenSSL-for-iPhone
	./build-libssl.sh
	# wait for ages while it builds openssl for x86, armv6, iPhone simulator, armv7 etc
	cp bin/iPhoneOS7.0-armv7.sdk/lib/*.a ../libs/   # the SDK version may be different for you.
	rm -rf src
	cd ..

That's it. iSpy knows where to find the resulting library, libGRMustache6-iOS.a. No further action required :)
